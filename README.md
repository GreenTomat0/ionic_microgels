Dynamics and Structural Ordering in Liquid-to-Glass Transitions of Ionic Microgels

This project explores the structural ordering and dynamics of ionic microgels across liquid-to-glass transitions. The experimental work, conducted by Prity Mohanty, involved particle synthesis, sample preparation, and confocal microscopy. The dataset includes ten samples of varying concentrations (S{N}), six samples with the same concentration as S6 but measured at different temperatures (S6nwT directory), and a comprehensive dataset (S6T34to18) capturing transitions across a temperature gradient from 34°C to 18°C.

Analysis of the confocal microscopy measurements includes:
<ul>
  <li>Image processing in ImageJ</li>
  <li>Particle tracking using Trackpy (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/trackpy/">Trackpy on PyPI</a>)</li>
  <li>Mean Square Shift (MSD) (to distinguish liquid mode from transient and glass mode)</li>
  <li>Non-Gaussian parameter (NGP) (distinguish the level of heterogeneity of particles under the influence of different external conditions)</li>
  <li>MSD curve slopes</li>
  <li>Volume fractions of samples</li>
  <li>Defining of clusters, and more.</li>
</ul>
