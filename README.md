Dynamics and Structural Ordering in Liquid-to-Glass Transitions of Ionic Microgels

This project explores the structural ordering and dynamics of ionic microgels across liquid-to-glass transitions. The experimental work, conducted by Prity Mohanty, involved particle synthesis, sample preparation, and confocal microscopy. The dataset includes ten samples of varying concentrations (S{N}), six samples with the same concentration as S6 but measured at different temperatures (S6nwT directory), and a comprehensive dataset (S6T34to18) capturing transitions across a temperature gradient from 34°C to 18°C.

Analysis of the confocal microscopy measurements includes:

Image processing in ImageJ
Particle tracking using Trackpy (<a href="[/](https://pypi.org/project/trackpy/)">Trackpy on PyPI</a>)
Calculations for:
Mean square displacement (MSD)
Non-Gaussian parameter (NGP)
MSD curve slopes
Volume fractions of samples, and more.
